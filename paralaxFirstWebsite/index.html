        Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this
        website. My programming journey started back in 2023, few months before
        I started studying Web&mobile app developement in SMIT Peshawar. I am
        currently student of 3rd semester in UOP and also learning skills in
        SMIT. I like coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding
        numbers to the complex ones like competitive programming problems. I
        love making projects and games. Infact this website is one of my Web
        Development Projects which is built using HTML and CSS.<br />
        <br />Languages known : C Language, C++, JavaScript.<br />
        IT Constructs : Data Structures and Algorithm, OOP, HTML, CSS, and Git &
        GitHub.
