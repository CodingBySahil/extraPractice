            With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain,
            an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether
            programming excites you or you feel stifled, wondering how to
            prepare for interview questions or how to ace data structures and
            algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop solution. With every tick of
            time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles on various
            computer science subjects to programming problems for practice, from
            basic to premium courses, from technologies to entrance
            examinations, we have been building ample content with superior
            quality. In a short span, we have built a community of 1 Million+
            Geeks around the world, 20,000+ Contributors and 500+ Campus
            Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation. Our success
            stories include a lot of students who benefitted in their placements
            and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
            network of geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.
